# dragon-battle
a NodeJS playground

This is just another OOP mini project. The purpose of this is to familiarise myself with JavaScript on Node, and OOP programming.

Not sure what will come out of this, but the idea is that dragons will move around on a board and they will fight each other and the user will be invited to bet on a winner.

# how does this work
This is a work in progress, but if you want to test it, here is what you should do:
+ download and install NodeJS
+ download this repo
+ in your console, go to the dragon-battle, and type "node battle.js" which means that the node engine will execute the battle.js file.
