# dragon-battle
a NodeJS playground

Just another OOP mini project.

Not sure what will come out of this, but the idea is that dragons will move around on a board and they will fight each other and the user will be invited to bet on each fight.

# how does this work
This is a work in progress, but if you want to test it, here is what you should do:
+ download and install NodeJS
+ download this repo
+ in your console, go to the dragon-battle, and type "node battle.js" which means that the node engine will execute the battle.js file.
